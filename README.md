# SwapMouse

Very niche scenario, but you might hanve a left handed mouse at work which you sometimes plug your laptop into. The left handed mouse auto flips the left click to be right click and vice versa. The issue is that if you've already flipped the mouse direction on your laptop then you will need to unflip it for the mouse to work. When you unplug the mouse you have to flip the mouse direction again. I have created a simple Windows form app to tell you what mouse direction is currently active and allow you to quickly change it
